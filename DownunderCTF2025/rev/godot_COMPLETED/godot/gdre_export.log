The following files were not converted because support has not been implemented yet:

---------------------------------IMPORTANT NOTES----------------------------------


Unsupported Resources Detected:
The following resource types were detected in the project that conversion is not implemented for yet.
See Export Report to see which resources were not exported.
You will still be able to edit the project in the editor regardless.
 - Resource Type: Resource, Format: dialogue (non-standard resource)



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Godot editor version 4.4.1 to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
