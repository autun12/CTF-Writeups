DESCRIPTION

  vqsort implements vectorized quicksort using avx2. this is the fastest
  way to sort integers. this goes as fast as djbsort for 32-bit integers
  except it supports 64-bit integers too, which go just as fast: about a
  gigabyte of memory sorted per second. It's 3x faster than simple radix
  sort. It's 5x faster than simple quicksort. It's 10x faster than qsort

LOCAL CHANGES

  Precompiled beacuse upstream codebase is slow, gigantic, and hairy.
