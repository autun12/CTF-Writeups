LOCAL CHANGES

  The only way this software differs from the normal InfoZIP sources is
  that we're linking the Cosmopolitan C Library, which enables it to be
  built as an Actually Portable Executable.

  Minor changes include:

  - Normalization of header / build config for platform / repository
    sed -i -e '/# *include  *<.*/d'  *.*
    sed -i -e 's!# *include  *"!#include "third_party/unzip/!' *.*

  - Fixed a lot of static analysis buffer overflow warnings.
