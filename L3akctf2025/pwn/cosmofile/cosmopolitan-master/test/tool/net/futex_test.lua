-- let's use futexes to implement a scalable mutex in lua
--
-- this example is designed to be the kind of thing that would be
-- extremely expensive if we were using spin locks, because we'll
-- have a lot of processes that wait a long time for something to
-- happen. futexes solve that by asking the kernel to help us out
-- and let the waiting processes sleep until the actual event.
--
-- here we have fifty processes, waiting one just one process, to
-- to finish a long-running task. if we used spin locks, then the
-- waiter procesess would eat up all the cpu. if you benchmark it
-- then be sure to note that WALL TIME will be the same, it's the
-- CPU USER TIME that gets pwnd.
--
-- uses    67 ms cpu time with futexes
-- uses 5,000 ms cpu time with spinlocks
