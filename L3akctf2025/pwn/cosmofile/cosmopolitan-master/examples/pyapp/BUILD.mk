# SYNOPSIS
#
#   Actually Portable Python Tutorial
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This tutorial demonstrates how to compile Python apps as tiny
#   static multiplatform APE executables as small as 1.9m in size
#   using Cosmopolitan, which is a BSD-style multitenant codebase
#
# GETTING STARTED
#
#   # run these commands after cloning the cosmo repo on linux
#   $ make -j8 o//examples/pyapp/pyapp
#   $ o//examples/pyapp/pyapp
#   cosmopolitan is cool!
#
# HOW IT WORKS
#
#   $ pyobj -m -o pyapp.o pyapp.py
#   $ ld -static -nostdlib -T o//ape/ape.lds ape.o crt.o \
#       pyapp.o \
#       cosmopolitan-python-stage2.a \
#       cosmopolitan-sqlite3.a \
#       cosmopolitan-linenoise.a \
#       cosmopolitan-bzip2.a \
#       cosmopolitan-python-stage1.a \
#       cosmopolitan.a
#   $ ./pyapp
#   cosmopolitan is cool!

# NOTES
#
#   If you enjoy this tutorial, let us know jtunney@gmail. If
#   you're building something cool, then we can we can add you to
#   our .gitowners file which grants you commit access so you can
#   indepnedently maintain your package, as part of the mono-repo

# We need to define how the repository source code path gets mapped
# into an APE ZIP file path. By convention, we place Python modules
# in `.python/` (which is accessible via open() system calls, using
# the synthetic path `"/zip/.python/"`) which means that if we want
# to turn `pyapp/pyapp.py` into `.python/pyapp.py` so it's imported
# using `import pyapp` then we can simply append to PYOBJ flags
# flags above asking it to strip one directory component and prefix
# Lastly be sure that whenever you use this variable override trick
# you only do it to .o files, since otherwise it'll ruin everything
# Passing -m to PYOBJ causes a C main() function to get yoinked
# and it means our Python module can no longer be used as a library
