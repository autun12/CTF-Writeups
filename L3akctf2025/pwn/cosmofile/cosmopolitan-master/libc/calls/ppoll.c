/**
 * Checks status on multiple file descriptors at once.
 *
 * This function is the same as saying:
 *
 *     sigset_t old;
 *     sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, sigmask, &old);
 *     poll(fds, nfds, timeout);
 *     sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, old, 0);
 *
 * Except it happens atomically when the kernel supports doing that. On
 * kernels such as XNU and NetBSD which don't, this wrapper will fall
 * back to using the example above. If you need ironclad assurances of
 * signal mask atomicity, then consider using pselect() which Cosmo Libc
 * guarantees to be atomic on all supported platforms.
 *
 * Servers that need to handle an unbounded number of client connections
 * should just create a separate thread for each client. poll(), ppoll()
 * and select() aren't scalable i/o solutions on any platform.
 *
 * On Windows it's only possible to poll 64 file descriptors at a time;
 * it's a limitation imposed by WSAPoll(). Cosmopolitan Libc's ppoll()
 * polyfill can go higher in some cases; for example, It's possible to
 * poll 64 sockets and 64 pipes/terminals at the same time. Furthermore,
 * elements whose fd field is set to a negative number are ignored and
 * will not count against this limit.
 *
 * One of the use cases for poll() is to quickly check if a number of
 * file descriptors are valid. The canonical way to do this is to set
 * events to 0 which prevents blocking and causes only the invalid,
 * hangup, and error statuses to be checked.
 *
 * On XNU, the POLLHUP and POLLERR statuses aren't checked unless either
 * POLLIN, POLLOUT, or POLLPRI are specified in the events field. Cosmo
 * will however polyfill the checking of POLLNVAL on XNU with the events
 * doesn't specify any of the above i/o events.
 *
 * When XNU and BSD OSes report POLLHUP, they will always set POLLIN too
 * when POLLIN is requested, even in cases when there isn't unread data.
 *
 * @param fds[ùëñ].fd should be a socket, input pipe, or conosle input
 *     and if it's a negative number then the entry is ignored, plus
 *     revents will be set to zero
 * @param fds[ùëñ].events flags can have POLLIN, POLLOUT, POLLPRI,
 *     POLLRDNORM, POLLWRNORM, POLLRDBAND, POLLWRBAND as well as
 *     POLLERR, POLLHUP, and POLLNVAL although the latter are
 *     always implied (assuming fd‚â•0) so they're ignored here
 * @param timeout_ms if 0 means don't wait and negative waits forever
 * @return number of `fds` whose revents field has been set to a nonzero
 *     number, 0 if the timeout elapsed without events, or -1 w/ errno
 * @return fds[ùëñ].revents is always zero initializaed and then will
 *     be populated with POLL{IN,OUT,PRI,HUP,ERR,NVAL} if something
 *     was determined about the file descriptor
 * @param timeout if null will block indefinitely
 * @param sigmask may be null in which case no mask change happens
 * @raise ECANCELED if thread was cancelled in masked mode
 * @raise EINVAL if `nfds` exceeded `RLIMIT_NOFILE`
 * @raise ENOMEM on failure to allocate memory
 * @raise EINVAL if `*timeout` is invalid
 * @raise EINTR if signal was delivered
 * @cancelationpoint
 * @asyncsignalsafe
 * @norestart
